Vue.js / Node.js / ExpressJS / Sqlite ( may be add mysql support in future)

What is this project about ? 

- Nothing but to create a simple todo application. 
- primarily to solve my home problem
- Learning exercise
- using this for few other projects.

Tools/Frameworks I chose to use

- Vue.js
- Bootstrap 4 beta.
- Express.js
- sqlite 3
- sublime text ( preferred IDE ) 
- email sender framework ( TBD )

Developer setup ( for local )

- clone this project

Any ideas or Issues , do open up or start a conversion.
